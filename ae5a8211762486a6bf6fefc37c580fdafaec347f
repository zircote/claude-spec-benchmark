# Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD Pipeline

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need continuous integration for the project. Options considered:

1. **GitHub Actions** - Native to GitHub, free for public repos
2. **CircleCI** - Powerful, good caching
3. **Jenkins** - Self-hosted, maximum control

## Decision

Use **GitHub Actions** with a comprehensive CI workflow.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Native GitHub integration
- Free for public repositories
- Matrix testing across Python versions
- Easy secrets management
- Large marketplace of actions

### Negative
- Limited free minutes for private repos
- YAML configuration can be verbose

### Neutral
- Workflow in .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Runs on push to main and PRs

## CI Pipeline

1. **Quality job**: ruff format, ruff check, mypy, bandit
2. **Test job**: pytest across Python 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
3. **Build job**: uv build, twine check, artifact upload

## Additional GitHub Config

- Issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- PR template with checklist
- Dependabot for dependency updates
- CODEOWNERS for review routing
