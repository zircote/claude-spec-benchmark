title: Use UV Package Manager with Python 3.14+

# Use UV Package Manager with Python 3.14+

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose package management tooling for the Python project. Options considered:

1. **pip + venv** - Standard library, universally available
2. **Poetry** - Popular, lock files, virtual env management
3. **UV (Astral)** - Modern, fast, Rust-based, pip-compatible

## Decision

Use **Astral UV** as the package manager with **Python 3.14+** as minimum version.

## Consequences

### Positive
- 10-100x faster than pip for dependency resolution
- Lock file support (uv.lock) for reproducibility
- Drop-in replacement for pip commands
- Native dependency groups support
- Active development and strong momentum

### Negative
- Relatively new tool (may have edge cases)
- Requires installation (not in stdlib)
- Python 3.14+ limits compatibility with older systems

### Neutral
- pyproject.toml remains the configuration source
- Compatible with pip for users who prefer it
- Makefile abstracts UV commands for convenience

## Implementation Notes

- `uv sync` for installation
- `uv run` for all tool invocations
- Dependency groups: dev, test (via [dependency-groups])
